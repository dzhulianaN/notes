If you watched the video, you know that our FlowrApp proposal has some shortcomings. Did you notice any 
potential problems in the written description that the video did not cover? In this unit, we’ll explore 
how we weren’t thinking.

Let’s say we launch our app in Seattle, where it is so successful that we are able to launch our service 
in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York City as proposed. Now we want to go international. So, we send 
our write-up to a Venture Capitalist friend who specializes in global startups in hopes that she will fund 
our expansion to Asia and Europe. She sends our proposal back … with comments.

Dear Team,

Congratulations on the success of AutoFlowr in the United States. I’ve reviewed your proposal and tested your 
app. While I see the potential, I’m not sure this is something I can get behind. Comments are below:

What is it?
AutoFlowr is an annual subscription service, managed via a mobile phone app, that automatically sends flowers 
to special people on holidays throughout the year:

Red roses for Valentine’s Day.
White lilies for Easter.
Spring bouquet for Mother’s Day.
Poinsettias for Christmas.
Here’s the first issue. “AutoFlowr” is a name that clearly summarizes what the service does—in English. Based 
on your success, it seems to resonate in the United States. My guess is that it won’t resonate in other countries, 
however. Let’s start with Japan. Although the Japanese often incorporate English words when there is no Japanese 
equivalent, they do have a word for “flower,” which is “hana.” “Auto” pronounced by a Japanese person is “oto,” 
which means “noise” or “man.” “Flower” pronounced by a Japanese person is “fu-ra-wa” or “fu-ro-wa”. “Furo” in 
Japanese means bath. So your app title could potentially be heard as “noisy bath” or “male bath,” neither of 
which conjure up images of holiday flowers. Do you see where I’m going with this?

Speaking of holidays, while Valentine’s day is huge in Japan, fewer than 1% of Japanese identify as Christians. 
Easter isn’t a big flower-giving day there. Not only that, sending someone white flowers could be shocking, as
white signifies death. In Japan, people wear white and send white flowers to funerals.

Where will it work?
We are starting our business in Seattle, Washington in the United States. If we are successful, we will expand our 
delivery service to San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York City. Once we’ve established ourselves, we will conquer 
markets in Paris, Tokyo, and Moscow.

I get your logic. You wanted to see if your service would take off in an area you know before expanding. 
Unfortunately, because you chose that strategy, you now have some serious challenges ahead if you want to take 
your service into other countries. You’ll have to make a lot of changes to your business model and app if you 
want to be successful in markets like the ones you list.

Who will use it?
Our app will appeal to all kinds of people:

Thoughtful, kind consumers who enjoy spreading happiness to the people around them.
Businesses who want to strengthen relationships with important clients.
I see that you’re targeting your audience by “psychographics” instead of “demographics.” That‘s an interesting 
strategy, as there are thoughtful people all over the world. However, when people in some cultures want to send 
a thoughtful gift, they don’t necessarily think of flowers first. The Japanese consider fruit, which is expensive 
in Japan, an impressive gift. The French might would feel the same about pastries or high-end chocolates. 
In France, patisseries outnumber florists. Have you considered expanding your offering beyond flowers?

How will customers use it?
Getting started with the AutoFlowr service requires only a few steps.

Customers download our mobile app and create an account.
They create a list of recipients and the addresses where we will deliver flowers.
They give us their credit card or PayPal information for billing purposes.
Here’s a red flag: address formats vary by country. Your app, as far as I can tell, can only accept American 
addresses. You’ll need to update that code.

Also, whereas a lot of people in the United States use credit cards or PayPal, people in other countries 
primarily use debit cards or mobile phones to make purchases. Some countries still rely on cash. Plus, currencies 
are also different. Have you thought about this? How are you going to process payments outside the US? Are you 
aware you’ll need to pay taxes to different agencies according to rules that vary by country?

At this point, customers can let the service take care of the rest. If they want to personalize the flower 
deliveries, however, they can do the following via the mobile app:

Add or subtract holidays from the delivery schedule.
Add delivery dates: birthdays, anniversaries, annual remembrances.
Add one-time deliveries to say “Thank You,” “I messed up,” “Congratulations,” “I’m sorry for your loss,” 
“Get well soon,” or “I like you.”
Select which flowers get delivered to each person on each occasion.
Choose from a variety of default messages to include on a card that gets sent with the flowers or write their 
own messages.
Personalization is always good. Customers like options. But you will need to change your default list for different 
countries as holidays vary widely. Japan celebrates Respect for the Aged Day, and a number of countries still 
have monarchs, whose birthdays are national holidays. Asia celebrates Chinese New Year and Golden Week. You 
should also think about which religious holidays to show in which countries. It probably won’t make much sense 
to have Easter, Christmas, and Palm Sunday on the default list for Israel. Speaking of which, Jewish holidays 
begin at sunset, so you’ll have to make it clear deliveries will occur the day BEFORE the celebration date listed 
in many calendars.

As for default messages, don’t just translate the ones you came up with for the United States. Have someone who 
was born and raised in your target market write new ones for you to make sure they’re appropriate.

Moreover, I’m concerned that using default messages goes against the purpose of your app. The app is supposed 
to give the impression the giver is thoughtful, when in fact, using default messages tells the recipient the 
app was more thoughtful than the flower senders. In some cultures, finding out you are on an automated list 
could be hurtful and damage a relationship rather than strengthen it.

How will it work?
We will develop the AutoFlowr app for the following platforms:

iPhone / iPad.
Android phones.
Windows phones.
Going cross-platform is a great idea. Just make sure you are familiar with what support each platform offers 
for globalized apps. They’re not necessarily consistent. I hope you have some good coders who know how to manage this.

For our first release, we will keep the app relatively simple. It will:

Use social media sign-in, supporting Facebook, Google+, Twitter, or Microsoft Account.
Allow customers to enter recipient information directly into the app, select individuals from their phone’s 
contact list, or select contacts from their social media accounts.
Download addresses for the recipient list from contact information if customers connect their AutoFlowr to 
their phone’s contact list or a social media account. If a specific contact does not include an address, 
the app will ask for one.
Select florists to deliver the flowers based on proximity to the delivery address. The app will put pushpins 
on a map so customers can look up the florists we assign.
Give customers the option to add reminders for who is getting which flowers on which occasion to their calendar.
Store all customer information in the cloud.
A couple of items from your technical list make me nervous. Have you looked into how flower distribution currently works in the countries you’re planning to target? Do you even know if local florists would be willing to work with you? Are you sure they have the technology to receive your orders, or get electronic payments? If you’re going to use the cloud, keep in mind that some countries, like Germany, insist that any sensitive information on its citizens be physically stored within the boundaries of their country.

Where will customers find the app?
We will distribute the app via the online app stores for each platform we’re targeting.

Online distribution is great. It’s relatively straightforward. It’s also easy to do a search and discover that 
you already have a number of competitors in local markets. Perhaps customers would rather sign-up with a local 
company. You should do more research on this.

How will we market the app?
We will market the app in several ways:

Descriptions on each online app store.
Social media, e.g., a Facebook page and Twitter feeds.
Partnerships with florists. We will ask them to promote our app in their stores and on their websites.
Don’t forget that some of the largest social media sites in the world don’t even exist in the United States, 
for example, China’s Qzone and Russia’s vkontakte.

Working with florists is an interesting idea, but you will have to carefully understand their customers to forge 
strong partnerships. Your app is best for people who don’t to go to flower shops in person. The personalized 
attention people get at a florist is a radically different experience than setting up an automated list, and 
it’s probably different country-by-country. The people who take the time to go to a florist may not be the same 
people who want to use your app. Moreover, there’s nothing to stop a local florist from offering a similar program 
to people who visit their shop. It just takes a one-time visit to set everything up, particularly if the list of 
recipients is short, and people can actually see the flower choices.

Lastly, how can you distinguish yourself in the market from the stalwarts who are your competition? How else can 
you get word out about it so it takes off in the Zeitgeist like Uber or Groupon? You’re an update of flower delivery 
services that have existed for at least a century. Uber allowed you to easily and quickly summon a car without 
having to hail one on the street. Groupon provided a searchable interface that was far superior to sorting through 
coupons. So, other than automating things so you can forget about the people you want to show you care about so 
deeply, what else do you bring to the table that will make you a household name?

Seems like our “solid thinking” missed a few important points—enough to earn a “no confidence” vote from our 
venture capitalist friend. But she gave us some great feedback. Let’s explore the issues she raised in more depth.
