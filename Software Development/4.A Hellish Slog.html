Let’s say you’re embarking on your first ever trip overseas—a whirlwind tour of five countries on three 
continents. You’ve been looking forward to this for years and you know it’s going to be amazing.

As your journey begins, your social media posts are full of enthusiasm and pics of you:

Checking in at the airport.
Buying Duty Free items you don’t really need at only slightly-less-expensive prices.
Relaxing in the waiting area, getting ready to board.
You take off and select a movie from the chock-full on-board entertainment system, but it’s in the language 
of the flight’s destination country—no subtitles. The same is true of the second and third movies you select. 
You’ve seen all of the movies available in your own language, English, so you turn to the passenger next to 
you to strike up a conversation.

She only speaks a few words and phrases of your language, so you stumble through in your high school version 
of her language about the adventure ahead of you. At first she looks befuddled, then amused, then horrified. 
She summons the flight attendant, and after she makes a passionate appeal, you find yourself reseated in the 
back of the plane, near the lavatory and in between two screaming infants.

Utterly drained upon arrival, you get stuck in the slowest line at customs, where they single you out for a 
search. The official spreads all your personal items across a table, confiscating several items that are not 
allowed into his country. And after an hour of questioning, he releases you.

At this point, all you want is a coffee. You order one in the airport, handing a large bill to the vendor who 
promptly hands it back, raising his hand in a gesture suggesting something unpleasant. “They switched the currency 
last year,” the tourist standing in line behind you comments smugly. He reaches forward with the correct currency 
and exchanges it for the coffee that should have been yours, ensuring that it passes right under your nose as he 
takes his first sip.

After another long wait, this time at the currency exchange window, you get in a taxi, fumble through a mispronounced 
explanation of your destination in the local language, to which your driver responds in perfect English. You give 
a forced smile for a selfie that you post to social media along with a story about your “fantastic flight” and 
“smooth traversal” of the airport, unaware that the data your phone is chugging down in the background will 
contribute to a $500 bill at the end of your month of travel.

Once you arrive at your hotel, all you want is a shower. It takes several minutes to figure out the hot and cold 
knobs are reversed, and then … heaven. The ancient, discount hotel (which you reserved online, of course) does not 
supply hairdryers. Fortunately, you brought your own—except you forgot the adapter. A desperate call to the front 
desk scores you one. So throwing on some clothes, in your dripping wet hair, you grumpily head down to fetch it, 
head back up to your room, plug in your hairdryer with a sigh of relief and…

Sparks shoot out of the wall socket as a noxious, burning smell fills the air. Then the power goes out and you’re 
in the dark. You open the window and then the room door to get a cross breeze going, at which point you realize 
the power is not just out in your room, it’s out the hallway. In fact, there’s no power in the entire hotel.

The hotel manager barrels toward your room, screaming and gesticulating at you. You try to explain you used what 
they gave you, until he barks, like you’re an idiot, that the voltages are different—you needed a converter in 
addition to an adapter, which he would have loaned you had you told him you were using a hairdryer. It is now 
officially all your fault.

Your next “cheerful” social media post explains that you’ve decided you can better immerse yourself in the local 
culture by staying at a youth hostel and hanging out with the locals.

The Lesson
The point of this sad story is that trying to use software outside the market it’s designed for can be just 
as hellish an experience. It can be annoying, frustrating, infuriating, or even—in today’s technology-dependent world—dangerous.
