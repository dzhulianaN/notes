Let’s say you’ve just finished your app. Getting the engineers and UX developers all on the same page 
to realize your vision was brutal, but now your baby is out there selling like mad. Everyone in the world 
wants it, but there’s just one problem: it’s only available in English. And it’s for a US audience. You 
figure you can just use some kind of translator, so you pull one off the Internet and translate your strings 
into German. But after you compile your German app and run it, the text is cut off. So, you realize you 
have more work to do.

In the meantime, people in other countries have downloaded the English version of your app, tried to use it, 
and got upset when they had trouble entering text in their own language. Worse, the “auto-correct” feature, 
which doesn’t understand any language other than English, suggests offensive words to some users. Now you’re 
getting hate mail. You discover retro-fitting your app for international markets is going to cost more than 
the original build. If you’d planned ahead, you’d be flying high. Instead, you’re apologizing and announcing 
delays for a global rollout.

You wouldn’t be the first to experience this nightmare. In this course, seasoned veterans who’ve been down 
that road will set you on the path toward global success.
