Any successful product starts with an idea that fulfills some kind of need.

A product idea may strike you when you encounter a challenge in your everyday life:

“I wish I had a way to...”
“There must be an easier way to...”
“I need a less expensive, more powerful, or more reliable alternative to…”
You may want to take advantage of new technology:

“This dream scenario is now possible.”
“This task will now become much less complicated and expensive to complete.”
“It will now be much faster/more entertaining/safer to do the things I want or need to do.”
Whatever idea you come up with, it will be your natural instinct to see it through your own lens and in the 
context of your own life and surroundings. Your product may be a hit with people who have similar tastes, 
lifestyles, or experiences as you, but that doesn’t mean it will be a hit with everyone else.

You simply can’t force fit a product into other markets. That’s why, if you want to create an app for the world, 
it’s important to think ahead. This may seem obvious, but a lot of companies have taken successful products to 
international markets without thoroughly vetting their chances for success. Do an Internet search on “products 
that flopped overseas,” and you’ll see in your results some really big names of companies that have learned painful 
lessons very publicly. Perhaps you have directly encountered a product that didn’t work for you or people you know.

When you’re considering a market for your software, you first have to ask yourself the following basic questions:

Would people in this market even want or need your software? Would anyone use it? Just because people find your 
app useful in one market, doesn’t mean people in other markets will.
Would people in this market be able to use your software even if they wanted to? Does their country have the right 
infrastructure? Do they have compatible devices? Would any regulations prohibit its use?
Is there any local competition? Would this market use your software over something built in their own country?
If your software does fill a need and people can and will want to use it, the next question is, would they pay 
to use it?
If they seem likely to pay for it, you now have to ask, “Will they pay enough for it to make shipping my software to 
their market worth the effort required?” The amount that people are willing to pay in the United States could be an 
entire month’s wages in another economy. Or perhaps the potential user audience is much smaller in this market 
than it is in yours.
This leads to the final question: “Can my software become popular enough for lots of people to pay for it and make 
it really worth my while?”
The answers to these questions, of course, depend on the type of software you’re creating. Perhaps you’re not 
building your software to sell in the mass market. Perhaps you’re building an app or Line-of-Business application 
for use inside your company. In this case, there’s another set of questions to ask:

Are there company employees who need to use the app but do not speak the language most employees speak?
Is the software critical for those employees to do their jobs? Will having the software that works for them 
increase job satisfaction and productivity?
Does the software need to account for regional differences? For example, software related to human resources might 
need to accommodate different hiring laws or benefits requirements.
If you answer no to any of these questions, that doesn’t mean you should abandon your idea. You may need to adjust 
it—or, to use a term we defined earlier—you may need to localize it.

There are also times when creating software for one market, even though it may not be hugely profitable, is 
important to your product’s success in a related market. Microsoft created a Spanish Catalan version of Windows 
in collaboration with the government of Spain, for example.

There are pitfalls in more directions than you can easily keep in your head. So it behooves you to plan ahead for 
each and every market you hope to target, consulting with people who know each market and its cultural expectations 
well. Let’s spend some time deciphering the differences you will encounter among markets.
