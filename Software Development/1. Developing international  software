With that in mind, here’s a great exercise for putting on your marketing and PR shoes: as part of your planning process, write your own press release, highlighting your software’s strongest selling points. Below is a form to get you started. You can replace the generic words in bold with words that match your project.

Today Team Name announced the availability of Software Name, a type of software that gives the target customer a powerful, inexpensive way to accomplish a task.

“We are thrilled to release this software to market,” said Your Name, your title, your company or team name. “We believe it addresses a gap in the market that will lead to big impact.”

Team Name has beta tested the product with a number of customers in specific international markets.

“Initial customer feedback has been outstanding,” said Your Name. Customers have told us positive things about their experiences using the software. Customers living in certain countries find Software Name particularly useful, because it addresses a need specific to their market that no one else has been able to address as well before now.”

Software Name includes a number of features that help users do a list of awesome things that will make everyone want to use the software regardless of where they are in the world.

Software Name is available today in list of countries, in list of languages language editions via where people can get it. It sells for price.

The above is a very simple example of a product announcement. The key points are to identify what your software does, who it is for, and what they will be able to accomplish using it. Now think about the list of markets you put into your press release:

Does the gap that your software addresses exist in all of your target markets?
Will your approach to addressing that gap be understandable and appealing to people in all of those markets, who come from different cultures and have different tastes?
Have you thought carefully about what constitutes a “great experience?” The experience needs to remain as great for someone who lives in one of your target markets and tries to interact with the experience in their own language.
Are you certain that people in your target market have access to the distribution channel you have selected?
Are you certain that the price you wish to charge would be considered reasonable in all of your target markets?
