How do you avoid the “Hellish Slog” we described previously?

Building software is a process of designing the user experience and then writing code to deliver that 
experience. It’s natural to design an experience that you would find useful in the context of your own 
life, and then to write code with that experience in mind. Doing so, however, could limit your success. 
So, what’s a development team to do?

Your instructors used to spend a great deal of time immersed in technical specifications, or specs. These 
days, “rapid development” is the new norm, and people generally iterate rather than plan an entire application 
in detail, in advance—at least beyond the Minimum Viable Product. It’s worth your time, however, to create a 
proposal before you start and have others review it, even for a small project. So, that’s what we’re going to 
do to illustrate the “do’s and don’ts” of the world-ready process.

Here, then, is the start of a proposal for “AutoFlowr”—a shopping app that delivers flowers. We chose which 
sections to include based on years of experience pitching ideas to executives and listening to pitches from 
startups. There’s no set formula for a proposal, but a good way to think about it is to imagine you are the one 
receiving the pitch. What kind of information would you need to decide to greenlight a project or invest? What 
kind of questions might you ask?

We can picture some of you getting a quizzical look on your face as you read through our proposal. This would 
make perfect sense, as it has some issues. This will become more clear as we progress through the course.

AutoFlowr: A “Flowers as a Service” App
What is it?
AutoFlowr is an annual subscription service, managed via a mobile phone app, that automatically sends flowers to 
special people on holidays throughout the year:

Red roses for Valentine’s Day.
White lilies for Easter.
Spring bouquet for Mother’s Day.
Poinsettias for Christmas.
Where will it work?
We are starting our business in Seattle, Washington in the United States. If we are successful, we will expand our 
delivery service to San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York City. Once we’ve established ourselves, we will 
conquer markets in Paris, Tokyo, and Moscow.

Who will use it?
Our app will appeal to all kinds of people:

Thoughtful, kind consumers who enjoy spreading happiness to the people around them.
Businesses who want to strengthen relationships with important clients.
How will customers use it?
Getting started with the AutoFlowr service requires only a few steps.

Customers download our mobile app and create an account.
They create a list of recipients and the addresses where we will deliver flowers.
They give us their credit card or PayPal information for billing purposes.
At this point, customers can let the service take care of the rest. If they want to personalize the flower 
deliveries, however, they can do the following via the mobile app:

Add or subtract holidays from the delivery schedule.
Add delivery dates: birthdays, anniversaries, annual remembrances.
Add one-time deliveries to say “Thank You,” “I messed up,” “Congratulations,” “I’m sorry for your loss,” 
“Get well soon,” or “I like you.”
Select which flowers get delivered to each person on each occasion.
Choose from a variety of default messages to include on a card that gets sent with the flowers or write their 
own messages.
How will it work?
We will develop the AutoFlowr app for the following platforms:

iPhone / iPad.
Android phones.
Windows phones.
For our first release, we will keep the app relatively simple. It will:

Use social media sign-in, supporting Facebook, Google+, Twitter, or Microsoft Account.
Allow customers to enter recipient information directly into the app, select individuals from their phone’s 
contact list, or select contacts from their social media accounts.
Download addresses for the recipient list from contact information if customers connect their AutoFlowr to their 
phone’s contact list or a social media account. If a specific contact does not include an address, the app will 
ask for one.
Select florists to deliver the flowers based on proximity to the delivery address. The app will put pushpins on a 
map so customers can look up the florists we assign.
Give customers the option to add reminders for who is getting which flowers on which occasion to their calendar.
Store all customer information in the cloud.
Where will customers find the app?
We will distribute the app via the online app stores for each platform we’re targeting.

How will we market the app?
We will market the app in several ways:

Descriptions on each online app store.
Social media, e.g., a Facebook page and Twitter feeds.
Partnerships with florists. We will ask them to promote our app in their stores and on their websites.
What could possibly go wrong?
We think our plan has some rock-solid thinking behind it. But some of you may have already noticed that our app 
could experience some hiccups once we try to expand outside the US market. The next two units will explain why.
