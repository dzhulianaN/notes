<h1>
Causes of mediocrity

<h4>

<p>
- Not asking for help - doing everything by myself<br>
- Neglecting my health and physical form<br>
- Neglecting manners, speaking, tone of voice<br>
- Having an undisciplined mind and not dealing with this issue. People donâ€™t<br> 
realise and fully understand the power of our mind. They understand the power<br> 
of the brain - everyone knows that if you are smart, you will earn a lot of money.<br> 
But is that the end goal? There are many rich people that will be forgotten and <br>
have never helped another human being. If you study in a good school or if you <br>
are talanted and are smarter than other and you think that's enough. <br>
<br>
The problem is that this story that everyone believes in is just one point of view.<br>
This is not enough to leave a mark in the world. To make a change, to make a good change<br>
in the world. To influence millions of lives for good. No, that's just being smart, having<br> 
a lot of money and even making people feel jealous and hate you for what you have.<br>
But if you desire is not only about money but to give back, then your fulfilling is much<br>
greater. Then you leave something for the human kind.<br>
<br>
However, this statement doesn't mean that money are evil and you don't have to dream about money.<br>
You will be fool if you don't dream about money and if you don't fight to have more money.<br>
If you disrespect money, they will never come to you. It's simple as that.<br>
And loving money is great, aiming for a better life, better self - that must be everyone's mission.<br>
Being better humans - this includes having more money, being better in our job, being better person,<br>
looking better, thinking differently, knowning more - it's a full package. It's not a single<br>
thing like - do better, help others. You have to help yourself first, before helping others.<br>
<br>
When I realise this true, it's so easy to be confident about asking for more without feeling<br>
pressured that people will judge me. The one that will judge me about what I want from life<br>
is the fooler who doesn't really understand the meaning of life and why we, the humans are here.<br>
It's not enough to exist. Even plants doesn't only exist. They give so much to the planet<br>
and to the humans and the animals. If you say that you don't want a lot from life, you are<br>
a simple person and you want a simple life, then is that simple life makes you better every day?<br>
If you don't embrace challenges and don't push yourself for being a better person until<br> 
your very last day, then why are you living? What's your mission in earth?<br>
Yes, you don't have to have a mission, maybe a mission is only to exist. Ah.. who knows.<br>
<br>
But I believe I must struggle, fight and act in order to inspire future humans because only<br>
through inspiration people act. Only inspiration give courage to achieve great things.<br> 
<br>
- Today, my inspiration comes from Ferdinand Magellan. This human that has never thought or suggest<br> 
that could inspire a modern women 500 years later. Exactly 500 years from his last day - 27.04.1521Y.<br> 
I wish he could knew about this. I wish I knew this human and had the chance to talk with him<br> 
or just to listen to his talks..or just to read some of his journals.<br> 
- Today, my inspiration comes from Abraham Lincoln. I wish he could knew that a women, 156years later<br> 
cry for his death and feel the pain of missing a very close friend. Someone who has never met..<br> 
in real physical world. But I meet Lincoln every day, I talk with him and I cry for him. It's so<br>
difficult to realise that such a human has lived in this earth. I wonder if he has ever thought<br>
that he will become such an inspiration for millions of people, many years later.<br>
<br>
I'm thinking about these 2 great men and wonder what they would think if I tell them the impact<br>
they have left after their deaths. How they would respond me if I tell them about their greatness.<br>
<br>
I wonder if I had the chance to go back in time and prevent their deaths. Will that be a good decision<br>
to save their lifes or were their deaths impacted the way we feel about them. Maybe I have feel<br>
such a pain of loosing them because the way they have died. And maybe I would never want to save<br>
them but only to tell them about the impact they have left. I'm sure that will be enough for them<br>
and they won't need to be saved. I wonder how many great people has left unknown and faith was unfair.<br>
<br>
- Not understanding the main principle of being part of the history. Not dreaming high enough.
