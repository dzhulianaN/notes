The beginning

Let's see. Yesterday was the first day of my challenge for the next 6 months.
The goal is to become a better version of myself.
To learn to say no.
To learn discipline.

To learn to make firm decisions and to never question this decision again.
But what if I realise I'm wrong in the middle of the decision and I realise that
I have to be flexible and to change according to circumstances?
Then, should I be firm decision maker or just stubborn in the wrong direction?

Well, I have always been flexible and I have always changed according to the circumstances.
So now, let's see if I try the other way and be a firm decision maker. So if I'm wrong
about the decison and I realise I'm wrong (or most often I try to convince myself that I'm wrong which
is just another excuse to my inner self) then let it be.

This will teach me to take responsabilities about my decisions and suffer when I'm wrong but 
there is no other way.

That is the way if I want to become a better version of myself.

-----
<strong>Decison:</strong>
I commit to accept my new self and give up my old beliefs.
I commit to be strict with my food and my trainings.
I commit to love my new choices.
I commit to love the challenge and the feel of a hunger.
I commit to not fight with the new habits but to accept.
I commit to have a positive attitude towards all the changes.

I have commited to love changes awhile ago.. maybe when I was 10 years old 
and that is the only thing I know about myself. This will be my key.
