The beginning

<p>
Let's see. Yesterday was the first day of my challenge for the next 6 months.<br>
The goal is to become a better version of myself.<br>
To learn to say no.<br>
To learn discipline.<br>
<br>
To learn to make firm decisions and to never question this decision again.<br>
But what if I realise I'm wrong in the middle of the decision and I realise that<br>
I have to be flexible and to change according to circumstances?<br>
Then, should I be firm decision maker or just stubborn in the wrong direction?<br>
<br>
Well, I have always been flexible and I have always changed according to the circumstances.<br>
So now, let's see if I try the other way and be a firm decision maker. So if I'm wrong<br>
about the decison and I realise I'm wrong (or most often I try to convince myself that I'm wrong which<br>
is just another excuse to my inner self) then let it be.<br>
<br>
This will teach me to take responsabilities about my decisions and suffer when I'm wrong but <br>
there is no other way.<br>

That is the way if I want to become a better version of myself.<br>
<br>
-----
<strong>Decison:</strong><br>
I commit to accept my new self and give up my old beliefs.<br>
I commit to be strict with my food and my trainings.<br>
I commit to love my new choices.<br>
I commit to love the challenge and the feel of a hunger.<br>
I commit to not fight with the new habits but to accept.<br>
I commit to have a positive attitude towards all the changes.<br>

I have commited to love changes awhile ago.. maybe when I was 10 years old <br>
and that is the only thing I know about myself. This will be my key. <br>
