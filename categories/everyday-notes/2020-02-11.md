"We have all the time there is it but how we make the best use of it?"<br>

1.By achieving an inner calm.<br>
Work undisturbed by what goes around me, focus on the highest impact tasks.<br>
<br>
2. By concentraining on one thing at a time.<br>
<br>
3. By aranging a routine for certain activities in certain hours, planning in advance for everything that must be done but at the same time keeping some flexability, enough to allow for unexpected.<br>
<br>
4. General pattern of good health for energy.<br>
