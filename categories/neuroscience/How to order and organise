// How to order and organise

From what I have tested and learnt so far, the most effective way 
to organise files and folder and help my future self to find them 
easier when I need there are 3 strict rules I must follow:

1. Don't sacrifice 5 sec of the current moment to label properly. 
2. Order by topic and alphabetical order.
3. Add sources and tags where possible.

If the information I collect over the years is not foundable when I
need it then all mu research is useless. The only thing that university
teaches us is where to find the right information when needed. 

The knowledge itself is not powerful if it is not used by purpose. Unorganised
information is not powerful at all and it doesn't make sense to be Unorganised
with all the information I found over time.
