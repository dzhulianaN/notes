// 1.3 Philosophy of AI

Alan Turing (1912-1954) was an English mathematician and logician. He is rightfully considered to be 
the father of computer science. Turing was fascinated by intelligence and thinking, and the possibility 
of simulating them by machines. Turing’s most prominent contribution to AI is his imitation game, which 
later became known as the Turing test.

One problem: does being human-like mean you are intelligent?

One criticism of the Turing test as a test for intelligence is that it may actually measure whether the 
computer behaves like a human more than whether it is intelligent. The test has indeed been “passed” by 
computer programs that keep changing the subject, make plenty of spelling errors, and sometimes refuse to 
respond at all. A famous example is Eugene Goostman, a 13-year-old Ukrainian boy who constantly tries to 
avoid answering questions by making jokes and changing the subject to his pet guineapig.

The Chinese room argument

The idea that intelligence is the same as intelligent behavior has been challenged by some. The best known 
counter-argument is John Searle’s Chinese Room thought experiment. Searle describes an experiment where a person 
who doesn't know Chinese is locked in a room. Outside the room is a person who can slip notes written in Chinese 
inside the room through a mail slot. The person inside the room is given a big manual where she can find detailed 
instructions for responding to the notes she receives from the outside.

Key terminology
General vs narrow AI

When reading the news, you might see the terms “general” and “narrow” AI. So what do these mean? Narrow AI refers 
to AI that handles one task. General AI, or Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) refers to a machine that can handle 
any intellectual task. All the AI methods we use today fall under narrow AI, with general AI being in the realm of 
science fiction. In fact, the ideal of AGI has been all but abandoned by the AI researchers because of lack of progress 
towards it in more than 50 years despite all the effort. In contrast, narrow AI makes progress in leaps and bounds.
Strong vs weak AI

A related dichotomy is “strong” and “weak” AI. This boils down to the above philosophical distinction between being 
intelligent and acting intelligently, which was emphasized by Searle. Strong AI would amount to a “mind” that is 
genuinely intelligent and self-conscious. Weak AI is what we actually have, namely systems that exhibit intelligent 
behaviors despite being “mere“ computers.
