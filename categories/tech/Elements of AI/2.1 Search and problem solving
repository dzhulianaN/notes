// 2.1 Search and problem solving

Many problems can be phrased as search problems. This requires that we start by formulating the alternative 
choices and their consequences. 

We will not focus on the actual search algorithms. Instead, we emphasize the first stage of the problem solving 
process: defining the choices and their consequences, which is often far from trivial and can require careful 
thinking. We also need to define what our goal is, or in other words, when we can consider the problem solved. 
After this has been done, we can look for a sequence of actions that leads from the initial state to the goal.

In this chapter, we will discuss two kinds of problems:

    Search and planning in static environments with only one “agent”
    Games with two-players (“agents”) competing against each other

These categories don’t cover all possible real-world scenarios, but they are generic enough to demonstrate the 
gmain concepts and techniques.
