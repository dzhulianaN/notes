Machine learning can be said to be a subfield of AI, which itself is a subfield of computer science (such categories are often somewhat imprecise and some parts of machine learning could be equally well or better belong to statistics). Machine learning enables AI solutions that are adaptive. A concise definition can be given as follows:



Key terminology
Machine learning

Systems that improve their performance in a given task with more and more experience or data.

Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning, which itself is a subfield of AI, which itself is a subfield of computer science.

Data science is a recent umbrella term (term that covers several subdisciplines) that includes machine learning and statistics, certain aspects of computer science including algorithms, data storage, and web application development. Data science is also a practical discipline that requires understanding of the domain in which it is applied in, for example, business or science: its purpose (what "added value" means), basic assumptions, and constraints. Data science solutions often involve at least a pinch of AI (but usually not as much as one would expect from the headlines).

Robotics means building and programming robots so that they can operate in complex, real-world scenarios. In a way, robotics is the ultimate challenge of AI since it requires a combination of virtually all areas of AI. For example:

    Computer vision and speech recognition for sensing the environment
    Natural language processing, information retrieval, and reasoning under uncertainty for processing instructions and predicting consequences of potential actions
    Cognitive modeling and affective computing (systems that respond to expressions of human feelings or that mimic feelings) for interacting and working together with humans
