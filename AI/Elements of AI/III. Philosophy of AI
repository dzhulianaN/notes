// The Turing test

Alan Turing (1912-1954) was an English mathematician and logician. He is rightfully considered to be 
the father of computer science. Turing was fascinated by intelligence and thinking, and the possibility 
of simulating them by machines. Turing’s most prominent contribution to AI is his imitation game, which 
later became known as the Turing test.
